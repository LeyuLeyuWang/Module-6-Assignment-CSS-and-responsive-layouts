                <h2>African American Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    Featuring framed prints created by prominent Black artists and activists Charles White and Elizabeth
                    Catlett, from the African American Collection, on display for the first time at the Central Library
                    since their donation in 1967. The Douglass-Truth Library received these prints through the tenacity
                    and determination of the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., who built the African American
                    Collection and saved the branch from closure in the 1960s.
